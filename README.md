<br>
After clicking `OK`, the string resources will be translated and created in the correct value folder.

##Feature

* Filter the strings you don't wanna translate by adding `NAL_` prefix to the `string key`, case sensitive. Change:<br>
`<string name="flurry_id">FLURRY_ID</string>`<br>
to<br>
`<string name="NAL_flurry_id">FLURRY_ID</string>`
